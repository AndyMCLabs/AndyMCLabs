👋 Hi, I’m @AndyMCLabs, your friendly neighborhood coder, part-time coffee enthusiast, and full-time breaker of code.

👀 I’m interested in anything that involves zeros, ones, or a high likelihood of causing an existential crisis at 3 AM.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to train my cat to debug code. If that doesn’t work, I’ll settle for learning more about machine learning, AI, and how to make my computer do cool stuff while I pretend to be productive.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds way cooler when you describe it to non-coders. Like, “I’m developing an AI-powered, blockchain-enabled, quantum-computing space app.” Sounds legit, right?

📫 How to reach me: Carrier pigeons are preferred, but email works too. Just make sure your message is encrypted with sarcasm and a touch of humor.

😄 Pronouns: Code/Debug/Repeat

⚡ Fun fact: I once coded an entire project just to prove that I could, then realized I was solving a problem that never existed. True story. 🙃
